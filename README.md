# Sankaku Channel Downloader
An unofficial app designed to download big number of images off Sankaku Channel

It has now been overhauled and made from scratch with the new Sankaku Channel API that is currently in beta.

## Usage
Authentication is now **optional**. You no longer need to enter your username and password to find posts.

1. Put your tags into the "**Tags**" textbox. *(Tags must be seperated with spaces and are not case sensitive.)*
2. Put tags you don't want the post to contain into the "**Blacklist**" textbox
3. Pick the download location by clicking on the path
4. Play with other settings...
5. Press "Start Downloading" and that's it


### Example of usage:

## Note
I made this "overhaul" entirely in one day so I haven't had the time to test everything yet. The API is also in beta, which means it can change at any time - breaking the app. I will try to keep it updated as long as it does not take too much of my time.
