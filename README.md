## UPDATE: This app will be built from scratch in the following months to fix all the issues.

# NO LONGER IN DEVELOPMENT

# Sankaku Channel Downloader
An unofficial app designed to download big number of images off Sankaku Channel

This was made as a side project and I decided to upload the source code here. It was quite rushed so the whole code structure is terrible - at least in my opinion. 

First created the API as a result of me playing around with HTTP requests/responses. This in turn resulted in this downloader. Except from fixing some bugs if I feel like it, I will most likely not continue developing this program.

# Description

To sum up, this program will try and find ALL the posts that fit your given criteria and attempt to download all of the original images/GIFs/Webms/MP4s into the specified directory.

Regardless or what kind of error the website returns - such as "Too many requests" or "Bad gateway" - this program will wait and keep retrying until it finishes it's job.

### Example of the program handling website errors:
